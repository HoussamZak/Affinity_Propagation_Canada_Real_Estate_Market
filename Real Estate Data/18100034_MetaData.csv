1,"This monthly CANSIM table replaces CANSIM table 330-0007 which has been archived. This CANSIM table contains monthly data starting from January 1981."
2,"The North American Product Classification System (NAPCS 2012) was adopted in the 2010-based Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) series. By using a new classification system, some historical series can no longer be calculated. Where possible, the historical series are published and consist of all data for the months prior to January 2010. They were obtained by linking together indexes from the 2010-based IPPI series and the corresponding 2002-based IPPI series. Also, these historical series were obtained by rebasing the 2002-based IPPI series using, as the rebasing factor, the ratio of 100 to the annual average index of 2010."
3,"On July 17, 2018, additional series for the Industrial Product Price Index and the Raw Materials Price Index are now available with a data quality indicator of “E”. Users are currently advised to use caution with these indexes. A project is underway to develop data quality indicators which will be updated on this table once complete."
4,"On July 17, 2018, additional historical data are available for select series upon request."
5,"On November 30, 2020, this table was archived and replaced by table 18100268."
